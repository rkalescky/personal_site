## Principal Scientist

Dr. Robert Kalescky was the Principal Scientist of the O'Donnell Data Science
and Research Computing Institute at SMU May 2024 to May 2025 and prior was an
HPC Applications Scientist at SMU since 2015. As the HPC Applications
Scientist, he provided consultations for the parallelization, performance
optimization, and scaling of research codes for use on SMU's HPC clusters, from
ManeFrame I and II to currently the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and M3. He received his
Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from Texas Tech University in 2006,
his Master of Science in Chemistry from the University of Texas at Dallas in
2009, and his Ph.D in Chemistry from SMU in 2014. His chemical research career
has spanned a wide breadth of length and time scales including some of the most
accurate quantum chemical calculations published for several small molecules,
large scale classical molecular dynamics simulations of nanoparticles and
proteins, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of extremely porous
materials as molecular sieves. Additionally, he has been working on the
development of computationally efficient machine-learned functionals for
density functional theory simulations. In 2020, he was awarded the SMU
President's Award for Innovation for his work assisting in the safe return of
students to campus during the COVID-19 pandemic.
